    "Reinforcement Learning (RL) is an exciting area of A.I that offers something entirely different to supervised or unsupervised techniques. In RL, an 'agent' learns to interact with an environment in a way that maximises the reward it receives with respect to some task. RL is distinct from supervised learning, which specifies via labelled examples the correct way for a system to act in every situation (whereas in RL only the end goal is specified, but not how to achieve it). It is also distinct from unsupervised learning, which although not dependent on examples of correct behaviour either, is concerned with finding hidden structure in unlabelled data rather than maximising reward signals.\n",

    "This tutorial focuses on two important and widely used RL algorithms, semi-gradient n-step Sarsa and Sarsa($\\lambda$), as applied to the Mountain Car problem. These algorithms, aside from being useful, pull together a lot of the key concepts in RL and so provide a great way to learn about RL more generally. Value functions, policy iteration, on vs off-policy control, bootstrapping, tabular vs approximate solution methods, state featurization and eligibility traces can all be understood by studying these two algorithms.\n",

For an equally weighted average we would choose $\\alpha=1/n$, where $n$ is the number of times the given state (or state-action) has been visited so far. However, most reinforcement learning problems are non-stationary, meaning that the true state and state-action values change over time as the policy changes towards an optimal one (see below). In this case it makes more sense to give more weight to recent returns than long-past returns, which can be achieved by holding $\\alpha$ constant.

    "The formulation we have used for the eligibility trace is called the accumulating trace: each time a state is visited the corresponding components of $\\mathbf{z}$ are bumped up, decaying away between visits. Another kind of trace is called the replacing trace, which resets the components back to $1$ on each state visit rather than growing them any further (i.e. the frequency with which components of $\\mathbf{w}$ have contributed to recent state valuations is dropped as a measure of eligibility).\n",

    "Suppose our states $s$ have two numerical dimensions, or features, $s_1$ and $s_2$. For example, $s_1$ could be position and $s_2$ velocity, as is the case with the Mountain Car task that we consider in part 2 of this tutorial. The most natural 'featurization' for $s$ would be $\\mathbf{x} = (s_1, s_2)^\\top$.\n",
    "\n",
    "A limitation of the linear value function approximator is that it can't take into account interactions between features, such as a high value for $s_1$ only being good in the presence of a positive value for $s_2$ in the example above. The only way to model such interdependencies would be to include in the featurization of $s$ features that combine $s_1$ and $s_2$. For example, we could use a polynomial featurization such as $\\mathbf{x}(s) = (1, s_1, s_2, s_1s_2, s_1s_2^2, s_1^2s_2, s_1^2s_2^2)^\\top$.\n",
    "\n",
    "Tile coding is another way to construct features that is more flexible and scalable than polynomial featurization. In tile coding, the state space is covered by multiple tilings, with each tiling composed of multiple tiles. The tilings are offset from one another by a fraction of the tile width. The state featurization $\\mathbf{x}(s)$ has one feature for each tile in each tiling, so if there are $n$ tilings and $k \\times k$ tiles in each tiling, $\\mathbf{x}(s) \\in \\mathbb{R}^{n \\times k \\times k}$. A particular feature is $1$ (active) if the state falls within the corresponding tile and $0$ (inactive) otherwise. Since every position in state space falls in exactly one tile in each of the $n$ tilings, there are always $n$ active features in $\\mathbf{x}(s)$. \n",

    "A nice side-effect of the above is that the learning rate $\\alpha$ in the [gradient update rule](#linear_approximation) can be set in an intuitive way. In particular, if $\\alpha=\\frac{1}{n}$, then the new estimate $\\hat{v}(s, \\mathbf{w}_{t+1}) = U_t$, regardless of the prior estimate $\\hat{v}(s, \\mathbf{w}_{t+1})$ (this follows from both the form of the gradient update rule as well as the form of $\\hat{v}(s, \\mathbf{w})$). Usually we only want to move some fraction ${x}$ of the way to the target $U_t$, which can be achieved by setting $\\alpha=\\frac{x}{n}$ instead. \n",
    "\n",
    "Tile coding ensures generalization because if we train at one state $s$, a single point in state space, then the weights associated with all ($n$) tiles covering $s$ will be updated. In turn, the approximate value function for all states within the union of these active tiles will change, proportional to the number of tiles they have in common. The shape and offset of the tiles will affect the type of generalization. For example, if the tiles are elongated along a particular dimension in state space, then generalization will extend further to states along this dimension. The number and size of the tiles will determine the finest level of discrimination possible between states - how far you have to move in state space in order to change at least one component of the featurization. \n",
    "\n",
    "Because tile coding uses binary features, the approximate value function $\\hat{v}(s, \\mathbf{w})$ in the linear case is almost trivial to compute:\n",
    "\n",
    "$$ \\hat{v}(s, \\mathbf{w}) = \\mathbf{w}^\\top \\mathbf{x}(s) = \\sum_i^d w_i x_i(s) \\equiv \\sum_{i \\in \\{x_i = 1\\}}w_i$$ \n",
    "\n",
    "In order to compute the approximate action-value function $\\hat{q}(s, a, \\mathbf{w})$, we simply need to replace $\\mathbf{x}(s)$ by $\\mathbf{x}(s, a)$. The latter can be computed by making the tilings cover the whole state-action space as opposed to just the state-space."

    "We now compare the performance of n-step Sarsa and Sarsa($\\lambda$) applied to the [Mountain Car problem](https://gym.openai.com/envs/MountainCarContinuous-v0/). This is a classic episodic task commonly used to benchmark RL algorithms, where the goal is to get a car to the top of a hill, the catch being that the engine is not strong enough on its own so the agent must learn to exploit gravity. \n",
    "\n",
    "The simulations we run use the implementations from [Part 2](#implementation). Note that for both algorithms we use the default of $\\epsilon=0$. This is OK because the Mountain Car environment yields a reward of $-1$ for each action unless it leads directly to the top of the hill (when it a yields reward of $0$). Our zero initialisation of the q-value function is therefore optimistic, and so the agent still explores (at least at the start of training). We also use the default of $\\gamma=1$ as discounting isn't strictly necessary in episodic tasks."

    "This tutorial has covered the theory and implementation of two important algorithms in RL, n-step Sarsa and Sarsa($\\lambda$). Judging by our experiments in [Part 2](#experiments), Sarsa($\\lambda$) appears to learn more efficiently than n-step Sarsa as applied to the Mountain Car task. The agent's ability to immediately learn from and respond to feedback from the environment rather than being delayed n-steps seems to pay off. \n",
    "\n",
    "By studying these two algorithms, we have covered most of the key areas of RL. However, there are two important areas that we didn't cover and that is off-policy methods (although we explained at a high level what this was in [section 1.5](#on_off_policy)) and policy gradient methods. Both n-step Sarsa and Sarsa($\\lambda$) have off-policy equivalents (so called Q-learning methods) that simulate sample experience from a behaviour policy different from the target policy we are actually learning about, but are otherwise the same as their on-policy counterparts. Policy gradient methods, on the other hand, introduce something entirely new. In these methods, optimal policies are not learned via value functions, but by first parameterising the policy and then optimising it directly via stochastic gradient descent, without consulting a value function at all. Off-policy methods and policy gradient methods are also well worth studying, as many state-of-the-art applications of RL employ such techniques.\n",
    "\n",
    "Of course we also haven't covered Deep Learning RL methods (such as Deep Q-Learning). However, these are essentially just methods that replace the linear function approximator that we have used with a neural network (we can also do away with tile coding since neural networks are non-linear function approximators already)."
